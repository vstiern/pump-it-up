# pump-it-up
Datadriven Challenge 

### Instructions 
Using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, can you predict which pumps are functional, which need some repairs, and which don't work at all? This is an intermediate-level practice competition. Predict one of these three classes based on a number of variables about what kind of pump is operating, when it was installed, and how it is managed. A smart understanding of which waterpoints will fail can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean, potable water is available to communities across Tanzania. 

### Goal 
Your goal is to predict the operating condition of a waterpoint for each record in the dataset. The labels in this dataset are simple. There are three possible values:

* functional - the waterpoint is operational and there are no repairs needed
* functional needs repair - the waterpoint is operational, but needs repairs
* non functional - the waterpoint is not operational
